'''
This file contains transformation functions. These
are all static functions so that numba can be used
efficiently.

Definition of each plane:

    disk: Face-on view of the galactic disk, no inclination angle.
          This will be cylindrically symmetric for most models

    gal:  Galaxy major/minor axis frame with inclination angle same as
          source plane. Will now be ~ellipsoidal for sini!=0

    source: View from the lensing source plane, rotated version of gal
            plane with theta = theta_intrinsic

    cen: View from the object-centered observed plane. Sheared version of
         source plane

    obs:  Observed image plane. Offset version of cen plane

class TransformableImage(object):
    '''
    This base class defines the transformation properties
    and structure for an image (e.g. velocity map, source
    intensity) that can be rendered in the various planes
    relevant to kinematic lensing: disk, gal, source, and obs

    The unifying feature of these images will be that their
    rendering in a given plane will be handled by the __call__
    attribute, along with the plane name, image coords to eval
    at, and any necessary transformation parameters
